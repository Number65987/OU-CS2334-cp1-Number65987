Class Notes Week 2


Write java method and signature. reverseArray- naming convention to follow. The first letter of word not capitalized, while the second word is. We want to define all methods as static. public static int[] 2 classes, 1 from the JDK 17 kit and the other class is created by the programmer. Inheritance

char is a primitive data type vs. String. String is a not a primitive data type and is a class type. Class: a means of creating new types. An object is one instance of a class. Each instance has its own memory. reference.

MEMORY ALLOCATION

The heap, contains the object and array. The stack contains the reference, value, and reference. The stack can get data from the heap with the reference. All class objects are stored in the heap, the same with arrays. INSTANCE METHODS Accessors: Methods used to report the state of objects. Mutators: Methods used to change the state of objects.

Getters, and Setters. Getters are accessor methods used to report the low-level state of objects. Setters, are mutator methods used to change the low-level state of objects.

If there are no methods that change the state of an object. These are called immutable classes. Examples are String, integer, float classes. Not changeable. There may be many methods that change the object's state, these classes are called mutable. For example, StringBuffer class.

A class can be used as an "Encapsulator." This allows for coders to read documentation of methods. UML (Unified Modeling Language). UML Diagram.

Class name on top. the methods in the bottom. The variable names as well as the methods names, arguments, and written type methods. The minus - means private data type. Some methods are public which are indicated are "+"

PUBLIC vs Private Data Public Pros: public data can be changed outside. Don't have to implement getters and setters.

Public Cons: Can't protect the data from other classes.

Each object gets its own copy of instance data. All objects in a class share one copy of class data. IN UML CLASS variables are underlined. Class variables are declared as static.

Method Overloading: Using the same method name but have different parameters.

"this" reference, is useful for confusing variable names.
